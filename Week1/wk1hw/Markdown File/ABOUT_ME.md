# **About Me**

My family was originally from El Salvador, I am first generation American, and I never took schooling seriously so now Iâ€™m trying my best to push myself past my boundaries and comfort zone. I know there is a lot of knowledge out there and I want to learn as much as I can in my lifetime and hopefully apply those skills for something greater than myself. I came across TheClubhou.se accidently from my brother in law who moved down here with my from NY with his family and have then decided that since I was coming down for a fresh start that this program wis aligned which my current interest in life as far as a career in being a developer. The Clubhou.se seemed like the perfect investment in myself to learn how to program to implement these skills to build a standard web application from the front-end design to back-end data management to start my journey as a Web Developer.
